# COVID 19 Homeless Dasbhoard
 
This dashboard is intended to provide information to inform planning and response efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic among persons experiencing homelessness in the United States.  The dashboard is intended to provide the following information at both the national and Continuum of Care (CoC) level:

1. Estimated size of the single adult homeless population, to provide a baseline understanding of scope of potential COVID-19 related impact and needs
2. Potential impact of COVID-19 on the single homeless population, including number of infections, number of hospitalizations, number of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and number of fatalities
3. Capacity needed to provide emergency accommodation to the single adult homeless population

The dashboard is based on [this report](https://works.bepress.com/dennis_culhane/237/) of the impact of COVID-19 on the homeless population and was created by the report's authors: [Dennis P. Culhane](https://www.sp2.upenn.edu/people/view/dennis-culhane/), [Dan Treglia](https://www.sp2.upenn.edu/people/view/dan-treglia/), & [Ken Steif](https://www.design.upenn.edu/city-regional-planning/phd/people/kenneth-steif) from the University of Pennsylvania, [Tom Byrne](https://www.bu.edu/ssw/profile/thomas-byrne/) from the Boston University School of Social Work and [Randall Kuhn](https://ph.ucla.edu/faculty/kuhn) from UCLA.

__DISCLAIMER__: The code is admittedly a bit rough, inelegant and not as well annotated as I would like as this dasbhoard was put together quickly and as the creator was learning the nuances of Shiny in the process! 

The dashboard will be updated regularly as new data become available and to add new information. Update announcements will be made [here on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TomHByrne).
